# Adafruit FX Programmer
This is a simple file manager for the [Adafruit Audio FX Sound-boards](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-audio-fx-sound-board/overview).

While programming the FX board is as simple as renaming files, and coping them over to the board.

It is still a very tedious process.

This programmer makes managing .wav and .ogg files on the FX board much easier.

# How to use

For each button:
* Drag and drop .wav, .ogg files to an empty slot in the buttons file list.
  * To add multiple files at once, drag and drop files or directories to the folder drop.
  * You can also use the built in file browser.
* Select a trigger mode
  * Trigger modes will default to Basic or Next for single files or multiple files respectively.

When you are satisfied with your layout, press the "Make" button to create a folder with all files in the proper naming scheme for the FX board.

You can even save your project, to use again later.

Enjoy!
