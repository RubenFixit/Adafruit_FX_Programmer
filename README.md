# Adafruit FX Programmer
This is a simple file manager for the [Adafruit Audio FX Sound-boards](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-audio-fx-sound-board/overview).

While programming the FX board is as simple as renaming files, it is still a very tedious process.

This programmer makes managing .wav and .ogg files on the FX board much easier.

# How to use

For each button:
* Drag and drop .wav, .ogg files to an empty slot in the buttons file list.
  * To add multiple files at once, drag and drop files or directories to the folder drop.
  * You can also use the built in file browser.
* Select a trigger mode
  * Trigger modes will default to Basic or Next for single files or multiple files respectively.

When you are satisfied with your layout, press the "Make" button to create a folder with all files in the proper naming scheme for the FX board.

You can even save your project, to use again later.

# How to install

## Windows
 1. Download the [installer](https://github.com/TangibleTec/Adafruit_FX_Programmer/raw/master/builds/Installer/Adafruit_FX_Installer.zip)
 2. Extract content of Adafruit_FX_Installer.zip
 3. Run setup.exe

## Mac & Linux
We don't have LabVIEW for these OS's yet.

If you can get LabVIEW in your native OS, then you should be able to use the source as is.

You could even build stand-alone software, if you really want to.


Enjoy!
